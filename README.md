# The Open Hip Dysplasia Dataset

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/955042700.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15086603)

A collection of DDH Datasets from across the Internet to help researchers and developers in the field of hip dysplasia.

Currently, the dataset includes Hip Images from 3 Sources, with both X-Ray and 2D Ultrasound:
- **Radiopedia**: with information on Graf Type, Alpha Angle, Coverage, Segmentations and relavent metadata. **Released on [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/legalcode)**
- **Hong Kong Polytechnic University**: with specific information on scan quality. **Released on [Apache V2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)**
- **MTDDH**: A 2000+ image dataset of X-Ray images of the hip, with 8 landmarks for Acetabular Index and Wilberg Angle, as well as IHDI & Tonnis Grades. **Released on [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**

## Data Snapshots

We use data snapshots to highlight important features of the datasets. They can be found in the README.md files of each dataset.

## Other Datasets

We also want to regognize the work of other labs who have created datasets that are not yet in this collection:
- [Acetabular-vision hip developmental dysplasiaâ€™s (AV-DDH)](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4gvcb6gmh2/1): AV-DDH dataset is a comprehensive collection of 2417 raw X-ray images and their corresponding annotated labels for diagnosing developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). **Released on [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**
- [A dataset of DDH x-ray images](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jf3pv98m9g/2) - The dataset used in the relevant research article included 354 subjects (120 DDH, 234 normal) . **Released on [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**

[The NIDUS Lab](https://nidusai.ca) has commited to enriching and simplifying Hip Datasets where possible, and adding their own datasets to the collection in the future.

## The "Open Hip" Pledge

**_To address the significant scarcity of data for AI-driven advancements in Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH), we pledge to make the Open Hip Dysplasia Dataset a robust and reliable resource. We will actively contribute new files across various modalities, including X-Ray, 3D, and 2D Sweep Videos, while simultaneously enhancing the quality of current data to maximize its utility for AI training and research. This will guarantee that anyone, regardless of their background, can access the data they need to make a meaningful impact in the field of Hip Dysplasia._**
