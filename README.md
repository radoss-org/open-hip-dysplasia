# The Open Hip Dysplasia Dataset

A collection of files from across the Internet to help researchers and developers in the field of hip dysplasia.

Currently, the dataset includes 2D Ultrasound Images from 2 Sources:
- Radiopedia: with information on Graf Type, Alpha Angle, Coverage and relavent metadata. **Released on [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/legalcode)**
- Hong Kong Polytechnic University: with specific information on scan quality. **Released on [Apache V2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)**

We also want to highlight an [X-Ray Dataset from the University of Jordan](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jf3pv98m9g/2). It contains 354 subjects (120 DDH, 234 normal) on the great unrestrictive [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. We are working on adding Acetabular Index labels to this dataset.

[The NIDUS Lab](https://nidusai.ca) has commited to adding scan quality, Alpha Angle, Coverage and Acetabular Index Labels, with the geometries used to create them, for the Radiopedia and University of Jordan datasets. This will happen as the relavent papers are released, hopefully before the end of Q2 2025.

## The "Open Hip" Pledge

To address the significant scarcity of data for AI-driven advancements in Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH), we pledge to make the Open Hip Dysplasia Dataset a robust and reliable resource. We will actively contribute new files across various modalities, including X-Ray, 3D, and 2D Sweep Videos, while simultaneously enhancing the quality of current data to maximize its utility for AI training and research. This will guarantee that anyone, regardless of their background, can access the data they need to make a meaningful impact in the field of Hip Dysplasia.
